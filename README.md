# 🌐 My First Portfolio Website

This repository contains my **first personal portfolio website**, built to showcase my background, projects, and research interests.

I want to express my gratitude to [Usama Jahangir](https://github.com/usamajahangir) 🙌 for creating such an amazing project and allowing me to fork and use it as a foundation. This version is serving as a **temporary portfolio** while I continue working on building my own fully customized portfolio project from scratch.
